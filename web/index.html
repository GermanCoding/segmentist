    <h3>Segmentist - Maximum Segment Size Test</h3>
    This is a test site to check whether a given HTTP(S) service appears to respect
    Maximum Segment Size (MSS) restrictions.

    <h4 class="py-2">What's MSS?</h4>
    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_segment_size">MSS</a> is the maximum
        size a data packet can have in a TCP segment. A TCP segment is the payload contained
        within TCP, i.e. the packet size without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">OSI</a> layer 2/3/4
        headers.
        MSS can be advertised by hosts during the TCP handshake and is often 1460 bytes, because the
        maximum size of an IP data-packet is often 1500 bytes, and the IPv4 and TCP headers are
        ~40 bytes long, though this can vary depending on options.
    </p>

    <h4 class="py-2">About this tool</h4>
    <p>
        This tool (source <a href="https://github.com/GermanCoding/segmentist">on GitHub</a>) allows you to test a
        certain server, identified by an URL, to check whether
        that host appears to honor the MSS advertised by a system. To do this, this tool advertises
        a <i>fake</i> MSS of 1000 bytes, even though the underlying network is capable of handling
        larger packets. We analyze raw network packets to check their sizes and then infer whether
        a host appears to honor the 1000 byte limit. 1000 bytes is much lower than what a usual
        network can handle, but it's also not unreasonably small.

        <h4 class="py-2">Limitations</h4>
        <ul class="text-start">
            <li>Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported. Custom ports are supported.
                No certificate verification is performed.
            </li>
            <li>Only IPv4 is supported at this time. IPv6 support is on the roadmap, but its
                a non-trivial amount of effort.
            </li>
            <li>Error messages are fairly basic, much like the entire tool.</li>
            <li>Fragmented IP packets can cause issues, if the fragmented packets are
                larger than the initial fragmented packet. This is due to a parser problem.
            </li>
            <li>If the HTTP(S) data exchange is too small, the tool may result inaccurate results,
                because the target never had a reason to send large packets. It is preferable to
                point this tool to URLs responding with at least 1KB of data.
